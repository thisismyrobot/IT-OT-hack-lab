I don't own these PDFs, they have been copied from the CLICK online
documentation at https://www.automationdirect.com.

I cannot find a licence to govern the redistribution of these PDFs, but I hope
that the storage of these files (for archival purposes only) constitutes fair
use. This project's root-level "Unlicence" Licence does not apply to the
contents of this folder.
